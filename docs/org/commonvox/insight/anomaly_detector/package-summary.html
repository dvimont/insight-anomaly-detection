 <br><hr>
 <h3>Dependencies</h3>
 In order to be executed, this package requires an environment in which
 <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">
 Java 1.8</a> and <a href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html"target="_blank">Maven</a>
 have been installed.
 <br><br>
 This being a completely standard Maven-managed Java project, all dependencies are outlined in the
 project's <code>pom.xml</code> file, and Maven automatically manages these dependencies at build time.
 A build is automatically executed when either of the customized <code>/run.sh</code> or
 <code>/insight_testsuite/run_tests.sh</code> shell scripts is executed.

 <hr>
 <h3>Command-line execution</h3>
 While this package provides an API (documented in these Javadocs pages) intended to allow direct
 incorporation of its functionality into any existing Java 1.8-compliant system (via methods of the
 <a href="TransactionProcessor.html#processStreamInput-java.util.stream.Stream-java.io.BufferedWriter-">
 TransactionProcessor class</a>), command-line execution may be done through submission of the
 following within this project's root directory. <b>(Note that an example of the following is
 provided in the customized <code>/run.sh</code> script file.)</b>:

 <pre>   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.commonvox.insight.anomaly_detector.App \
      -Dexec.args="./log_input/batch_log.json ./log_input/stream_log.json ./log_output/flagged_purchases.json"</pre>

 The arguments on the second line above are mandatory, and should be tailored to represent the
 relative paths for three files:
 <ol>
   <li>INPUT FILE containing <b><i>batch transactions</i></b> (used for initialization)</li>
   <li>INPUT FILE containing <b><i>streaming transactions</i></b> (analyzed for potential anomaly purchases)</li>
   <li>OUTPUT FILE (not necessarily an existing file) for <b><i>flagged purchases</i></b> (i.e. anomaly purchases)</li>
 </ol>

 Note that the transactions contained in all three files adhere to a proprietary JSON layout
 particular to Market-ter's systems, established via exemplars in
 <a href="https://github.com/InsightDataScience/anomaly_detection#input-data" target="_blank">
 the original specifications</a>.

 <hr>
 <h3>Customization of shell scripts was required</h3>
 The original specifications provided two shell scripts, (1) <code>run.sh</code> and (2)
 <code>/insight_testsuite/run_tests.sh</code>, both of which required customization. Notably,
 the <code>/insight_testsuite/run_tests.sh</code> shell script required the addition of two lines,
 both corresponding to the standard <code>pom.xml</code> Maven project file.
 <br><br>
 <b>WARNING</b>: If the originally-provided <code>run.sh</code> and/or <code>run_tests.sh</code> scripts
 (which do not include inserted lines for Maven-style execution and to properly handle the Maven
 <code>pom.xml</code> file) are run against this package, a "BUILD FAILURE" will likely be encountered,
 with ERROR messages outputted potentially including:<br>
 "<code>[ERROR] The goal you specified requires a project to execute but there is no POM in this
 directory ... Please verify you invoked Maven from the correct directory.</code>"

 <hr>
 <h3>Naming conventions</h3>
 The author of this package is a strong proponent of the dictums "call it what it is" and "don't
 give it another name if it's already got one". Thus, wherever possible, the names used in
 classes and methods of this package adhere to all explicit and implied naming conventions
 spelled out in the
 <a href="https://github.com/InsightDataScience/anomaly_detection#table-of-contents" target="_blank">
 original specifications</a>. Experience shows that a persistent adherence
 to such naming policies can yield dividends as a project grows to potentially involve
 more people and expand in complexity. In other words, solid and consistent naming conventions
 can help give a project like this an improved human and organizational "scalability".

 <hr>
 <h3>Note on JSON format and output processing</h3>
 The <a href="https://github.com/InsightDataScience/anomaly_detection#table-of-contents" target="_blank">
 original specifications</a> for the format of JSON input and output used in this package impose an
 extra constraint outside of established JSON standards: the original specifications require
 that the elements in each JSON object (the name:value pairs between curly brackets) be kept in
 a specific order. A relatively recent
 <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt" target="_blank">clarification document</a>
 from the authorities overseeing JSON standards explicitly states that
 "[a JSON] object is an <b>unordered</b> collection of zero or more name/value pairs".
 <br><br>
 For those of us with extensive experience working with interoperability issues among homegrown
 toolkits and technologies produced by our corporate clients, it is neither
 surprising nor unusual to come across constraints such as the one imposed in this exercise:
 that the ordering of object-elements in a particular setting might need to be maintained in a
 <i>non-standard</i> way.
 <br><br>
 With that said, the maintaining of order in the elements of an outputted JSON object does not
 come without a potential hit to the efficiency of such processing. In the solution presented
 here, a Java StringBuilder is used to (as efficiently as possible, yet rather crudely) "inject"
 the <b><code>mean</code></b> and <b><code>sd</code></b> elements into the end of the outputted
 "flagged_purchases" JSON objects.
 If this were a real-world engagement with a corporate client, one would inquire whether the
 applications which consume the "flagged_purchases" are indeed hard-wired to require
 specifically-ordered JSON objects, or whether this constraint can be removed from the project
 specifications, allowing for more efficient outputting of "natural" (i.e. unordered) JSON object
 content.

 <hr>
 <h3>Validation of JSON input</h3>
 While there was no explicit mention in the specifications regarding validation of input coming
 from JSON batch files or streams, it may well be that validation is needed (assuring things like
 valid timestamp formats, numeric and non-negative amounts in purchases, and whatever might
 constitute a valid
 user-id). On the other hand, the distributed architectures of an enterprise such as Market-ter
 might well provide for such validations "upstream" from this package's processes, obviating
 the need for the addition of validation logic (and its attendant overhead) in this package.
 The current implementation includes <i>no</i> validation for inputted JSON values, but validation logic
 could easily be added, if required. Additionally, a system-level variable or config parameter
 might be utilized to optionally activate or deactivate this new "layer" of validation processing.

 <hr>
 <h3>Choice of JSON parser</h3>
 There are a number of reliable Java-based JSON parser packages available. In searching for
 an appropriate choice for this project, a brief research  endeavor led to the selection of
 <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/" target="_blank"><i>JSON.simple</i></a>,
 which seems to offer both reliability and road-tested efficiency. Note that it would be
 extremely easy to swap out this JSON parser and replace it with any other (the beauty of open
 standards!).

 <hr>
 <h3>Unit testing</h3>
 The standard <a href="http://junit.org" target="_blank">JUnit package</a> is being employed
 for unit testing. A complete array of unit tests, covering all non-private methods in the
 User and PurchaseManager classes, can be found in the subdirectories of <code>./src/test/java/</code>.

 <hr>
 <h3>Note that this implementation is not synchronized</h3>
 This initial prototype is intended for single-threaded use. In its current form, a
 <a href="TransactionProcessor.html">TransactionProcessor</a>
 is not intended to be concurrently accessed by multiple threads.

 <hr>
 <h3>Scalability issue 1: efficiency in maintenance of collections</h3>
 In choosing which of the standard Java Collection classes to utilize in this package, the focus
 was on scalability: as the size of users, networks, and purchase-maps potentially expands
 in the future, it was vital to guarantee the advantages of binary searches [O(log(n) efficiency]
 over sequential searches [O(n) efficiency]. A quick glance at the "import" statements at the
 top of the User class and the PurchaseManager class of this package shows that only TreeSet
 and TreeMap implementations are currently in use, taking advantage of their
 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html" target="_blank">
 "guaranteed log(n) time cost for basic operations"</a>.

 <hr>
 <h3>Scalability issue 2: minimizing data conversions</h3>
 Since it was clear that some data conversion would be necessary to fulfill the project
 requirements (most obviously the conversion of String-based amounts into a numeric format),
 a focus was applied to minimizing these conversions (to the extent reasonable and feasible),
 since such conversions have an impact on efficiency and scalability. The current policies for
 conversions are as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>all <i>amounts</i> read in from JSON streams will immediately be converted to numeric format
 and held and manipulated in memory in numeric format;</li>
 <li>all <i>timestamps</i> and <i>user IDs</i> will never be converted, but instead kept in their
 original String format;</li>
 <li>the <i>System#nanoTime</i> values used to establish unique purchase-transaction-keys are
 always held in memory in their original, long (numeric) format.</li>
 </ul>

 <hr>
 <h3>Scalability issue 3: simplifying computations</h3>
 In the first moments of design of this package, the knee-jerk selection of the BigDecimal class
 was made as the "container" of choice for amount data (converted from inputted JSON Strings);
 after all, both the standard Java documentation and a not-so-small army of Java gurus all
 implore us to use BigDecimal objects when dealing with currency! But just a little thought
 led to the realization that if amounts were held in memory as <i>pennies</i> instead of
 <i>dollars</i>, that the complexity (and potential overhead, particularly in calculations) of
 the BigDecimal class could be completely avoided! Thus, the Integer class (and primitive "int"
 instances, where appropriate) are used for holding all amounts in memory (in "penny"
 denominations) and for performing all computations, rounded to the nearest penny.

 <hr>
 <h3>Scalability issue 4: readiness for distributed processing</h3>
 While it was outside of the explicit scope of this project, Java 1.8 makes Stream management
 an integral (and pretty much automatic) part of its architecture. Thus, while the
 TransactionProcessor class handles batch-style input of a "stream_log" file (in fulfillment
 of the original specification), it also is
 architected (though never yet tested) to handle real-time streaming input. It is easy to
 envision usage of a suitably tested version of this package in a distributed Hadoop, HBase, or
 other distributed processing framework, directly accepting streaming data via the
 <a href="TransactionProcessor.html#processStreamInput-java.util.stream.Stream-java.io.BufferedWriter-">
 TransactionProcessor#processStreamInput method</a>.

 <hr>
 <h3>EXTRA DELIVERABLE: Prevention of out-of-sequence befriending and unfriending</h3>
 During initial design of the User#befriend and User#unfriend methods, it became obvious that
 in a real-world implementation, just as purchase transactions might be received from their
 originating Internet sources <i>out of sequence</i>, so too might befriend and unfriend
 transactions be received <i>out of sequence</i>.
 <br><br>
 To handle this eventuality, extra functionality was added to this package seeking to assure
 that:
 <ul>
 <li>an <i>unfriend</i> transaction will be ignored if its submitted timestamp precedes
 the timestamp of the most recent (already-submitted) <i>befriend</i> transaction, and</li>
 <li>a <i>befriend</i> transaction will be ignored if its submitted timestamp precedes
 the timestamp of the most recent (already-submitted) <i>unfriend</i> transaction.</li>
 </ul>

 <hr>
 <h3>EXTRA DELIVERABLE: No overlay of an already-existing "flagged_purchases" output file</h3>
 It seems potentially dangerous to automatically overlay output files from previous batch
 runs of this package. Thus, a newly commencing batch run of this package automatically renames
 any existing "flagged_purchases" output file it finds (by appending a "." + string-timestamp
 suffix, followed by a final suffix of ".json" to the file name).

 <hr>
 <h3>AN ADDITIONAL THOUGHT: Regarding outliers</h3>
 While it was far outside of the scope of this exercise, as various sets of test data were being
 put through the anomaly-detection algorithms, it became apparent that the addition of a
 single <b>extremely</b> anomalous purchase could, in effect, shut down anomaly identification
 for any user within the network of the extreme purchaser. Until the extreme
 purchase ultimately cycled out of the "recent purchases" pool, almost nothing would be rated as an
 anomaly. This leads to a suspicion that any real-world system that attempted
 to accomplish similar goals of anomaly detection would need to employ more advanced algorithms
 to identify and remove "outlier" purchases from consideration in the anomaly-detection process.</div>
